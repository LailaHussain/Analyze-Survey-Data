# Analyze-Survey-Data
Udacity - Data Foundations Nanodegree
## Project Overview
In this project, you will analyze a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, so it isn't perfect. It is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing). You will need to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate your findings about it. You will use spreadsheets to make your analysis easier (please do not analyze by hand - it will take forever!).

Prepare with the descriptive statistics and spreadsheets lessons leading up to the project.
## Project Details
## Introduction
For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a presentation to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it - the questions leading to this page should have assisted in this process! Then you should use spreadsheets or another Excel-like software to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. This project is open-ended in that there is not one right answer.

### Step One - Understanding the Data - How the Data Were Collected
It is common practice in marketing to send surveys to learn about your audience, and build a product that best meets their needs. The survey that this project is based of off was sent to just do that for Udacity to learn about the students across many of their programs! Download the dataset of responses from the Resources to your local machine. The dataset can also be found in the resources.

### Step Two - Get Organized
When you complete your analysis and presentation youâ€™ll want to submit your project (and share it with friends, family, and employers). Get organized before you begin. I recommend creating a single folder that will eventually contain:

The report communicating your findings
The original data set (which you will not need to submit)
A copy of the spreadsheet workbook you used to do the analysis for your report (which you will need to submit)
### Step Three - Analyze Your Data
Look through the survey questions and brainstorm some questions you could answer, then use the .csv file to answer your questions. Here are some ideas to get you started:

What is the most common way people find out about Udacity?
What is the highest level of education for most students?
What is the most common Nanodegree program represented in the survey results?
Is there a connection between the Nanodegree certificate earned and job title?
What are the most common countries/cities where students live?
How many hours per week do students spend on projects/content? Does this differ by program?
Are there any interesting findings regarding sleep, commute times, amount of time sitting per day, etc. worth mentioning? Does this differ by where someone lives? Does this differ by Nanodegree program or job title?
Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between variables, as well as questions about individual columns.

### Step Four - Create Your Presentation
Once you have finished analyzing the data, create a presentation that shares the findings you found most interesting. You should clearly communicate what broad conclusions you are able to make, and provide a visual or numeric values associated with your finding.

Your presentation should include:

Four slides
One visualization and at least one numeric summary statistic about a finding per slide. An appropriate visual might be a bar chart, histogram, scatterplot, box-plot or other visual that you learned to make in spreadsheets.
A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide
